Coding convolutions and pooling layers
The concepts introduced in this video are available as [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D) layers and [MaxPooling2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D) layers in TensorFlow. You’ll learn how to implement them in code in the next video…


For more details on convolutions and how they work, there's a great set of resources [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF).
